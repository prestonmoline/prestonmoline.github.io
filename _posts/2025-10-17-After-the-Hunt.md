**Short Review:**
This is not a good movie. The trailers make it seem like it’s going to be a well-written, thought provoking movie about prevalent issues into today’s society. This movie is poorly written, has no likable characters, it has no perceivable plot, it has nothing of importance to say about the topic of the movie, and worst of all, it lacked purpose. Whatever you do, just avoid this movie.


**Rating:**
.5/5
