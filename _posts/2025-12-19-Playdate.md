**Short Review:**
Seeing Kevin James and Alan Ritchson in a movie together was everything that I wanted it to be. They themselves had fantastic banter back and forth, and it was fun seeing Alan Ritchson try so hard to be funny. Where the movie falls apart is that the story seemed like it was the first idea they had and just went with it. While I understand that the story wasn’t supposed to be the main draw/purpose of the movie (which was the humor/comedy), I was expecting it to be at least decent. While I also loved Kevin James and Alan Ritchson together for the humor, they couldn’t fully save the poorly written script. Most of their lines were them saying something absolutely ludicrous and then swearing a ton. The lines were funny because of how stupid and random they were rather than them being clever jokes. Overall, the movie is extremely watchable, and while it is funny, the humor cannot save the movie from having an absolutely stupid story that wasn't super entertaining.


**Rating:**
2.5/5
