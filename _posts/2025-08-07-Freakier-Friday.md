**Review:**
After growing up having never seen ‘Freaky Friday’ I had my reservations about seeing its sequel. The trailers didn’t intrigue me that much, and I didn’t think the trailer was even that funny. Because of this, I really was not looking forward to watching this one, even after watching the original a week before seeing this one. To my pleasant surprise, I enjoyed the movie much more than I anticipated.

At the beginning, the movie does take a while to get into the main plot. I’ve seen several takes online where people hated the beginning because it was just too slow and boring, but I thought it was a good way to reintroduce us to the characters, where they are now, what is important to them, and what is going to drive the main plot of the movie, even if it was a little slow and long. Once you get to the point of the story where everyone is swapping bodies is when everything starts to pick up and becomes much more interesting.

The main plot of the movie revolves around Lindsay Lohan’s character getting married, and her daughter and soon-to-be daughter-in-law are trying to stop the wedding. I think this is a fun sequel idea, but it’s basically the same idea as the original with 2 additional characters, which made the plot feel extremely bland. I was really hoping they would come up with something a little more original and way less predictable. 

Despite the disappointing and underwhelming plot, I was surprised by how much funnier the movie was compared to my expectations. Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan were and still are a great comedic duo in this role. Every time they were on screen getting into shenanigans they always gave it their all and they had, and every time the new girls (the daughter and future daughter-in-law) came on screen, they weren’t as good as Jamie Lee and Lindsay (I thought they were just annoying instead of funny), so it made me want to just see the older characters the whole time as they were more fun. 

After seeing the original a week ago I was a little disappointed that it wasn’t as funny as I had expected since most of the humor was 20+ years old. Since this movie is new and “modern,” the humor actually worked for me and was more naturally funny. I felt I was laughing more at one-liners too, which is a shout out to the improv of the actors or the clever writing. Also being fun, there are some story elements that are cheesy, but since I saw this movie with my brother, we were cracking throughout the movie (especially near the end), and this just made the movie even funnier and even more worth-while to watch.

Even though this movie is not my type of movie at all, I was pleasantly surprised by it, and if you are a fan of the original, you’ll absolutely adore this movie. It’s good, family fun. It is also one of my wife’s favorite movies she’s seen this year (and probably one of her favorites from the last few years).



**Rating:**
3.5/5
