**Short Review:**
I think the movie is fun. Timothee Chalmet did a good job as Wonka, and the new songs were pretty good! I think the story is a little cheesy, but I also understand that this is a PG movie meant for kids. I think the worst thing I can say about this movie is that I saw this movie early December (I’m writing this late June) and I cannot remember any standout moments from the film. I think this is one of those movies I wouldn’t watch a lot unless I had young kids

**Rating:**
3.5/5
