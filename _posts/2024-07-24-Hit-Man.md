**Short Review**
This movie is very fun and enjoyable. It is part rom com and crime procedural. The movie’s main asset (besides Glen Powell) is its uniqueness. Building a story on a man who pretends to be a hit man for the police is such a fun premise, and more movies should have a similar premise. As for Glen Powell, he is perfect in this role. He seamlessly goes between playing an awkward professor to a different hit man, even adding endless charisma to his Ron character. The sex scenes were unnecessary and should have been implied rather than shown. Overall, I recommend watching this, especially if you’re a Glen Powell fan.


**Rating:**
4/5
