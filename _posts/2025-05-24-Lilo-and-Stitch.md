**Short Review:**
This is one of the better live-action Disney remakes of the last few years, being leagues better than Snow White and Mufasa (even better than Moana 2). What makes this so much better than the other movies is that it got the main 3 major aspects of the original movie correct - (1) the Lilo and Stitch dynamic, (2) the focus on Ohana/family, and (3) the relationship between Nani and Lilo. Stitch is as devious as ever, and Lilo is just adorable, and the fact that the girl playing Lilo was only 7 at the time of filming, having to act against a non-existent/CGI Stitch is quite impressive. I also enjoyed how this movie, just like the Fast and Furious movies, was all about family. While at times it seemed like they had to force in an “Ohana” quote, it’s always nice to see a movie that focuses on the importance of staying together as a family.

Overall, I didn’t overtly dislike anything about this movie, the movie didn’t do anything that truly WOW’d me. The movie plays it safe and hits a solid double, it is short and sweet, and I think kids will love and be very fond of this movie.


**Rating:**
3.5/5 (almost a 4/5)
