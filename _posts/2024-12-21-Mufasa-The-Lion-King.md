**Short Review:**
I’m struggling for words about the movie. It wasn’t bad, but nothing stood out as great. I rewatched the original for the first time in 15 years and I fell in love with the story and how they told a story about growing up to become someone more than you think you’re capable of. While the movie was beautiful to watch, the story about brotherhood was very mediocre, and the songs were just alright (better than Moana). Mufasa and Scar were brothers who didn’t spend time with each other until they were on the run with each other, and by the end Scar’s eventual downfall was extremely cheesy and very rushed (the best version of brothers becoming enemies was in Transformers One with Megatron and Optimus Prime). Overall, I think this movie is worth a watch once (probably on Disney+), but that’s it. I don’t think this movie adds much to the original at all, and I think they should have found a more profound story to tell.


**Rating:**
2.5/5
