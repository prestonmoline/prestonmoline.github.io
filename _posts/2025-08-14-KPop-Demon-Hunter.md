**Short Review:**
There are a lot of make-or-break factors when it comes to enjoying this movie. The first is that you have to be completely willing to buy into the premise of the movie. You have to be willing to accept and enjoy the fact that there are these KPop singers who have been singing for generations, and it is through their singing (and fighting) that they have been protecting the world from demons. The second major factor is that you have to be willing to listen to KPop songs constantly throughout the movie, for better or for worse. If you are down for both of these, you will really enjoy the movie, as it is very well made, uniquely animated, and the fact that it is an extremely original idea. As for what I thought of the movie, I really think the whole premise of singing KPop songs to protect the world from demons is a dumb, silly idea. I also am not a huge fan of watching musicals, so the fact that there is constant singing by the main characters throughout the movie kinda took away the enjoyment from the movie. While there were some songs that were pretty good, but there were other songs that were just annoying. While I didn’t enjoy the story, I found the animation to be quite good, and I really enjoyed the way the animation was able to use color, especially reds and purples.

Overall, I didn’t care for the movie, but I know everyone else loves it. Even though I didn’t love it, I can see why other people do, especially kids. I also know my wife absolutely adored this movie, so take everything that I said with a grain of salt because I’m pretty sure I’m one of the only people who didn’t like this movie
