**Short Review:**
“Cleaner” is a good, simple action movie. The beginning is a little slow, taking it a bit to have the story and movie to pick up into full gear, but once it does it is quite entertaining. The writing throughout the movie is hit or miss though. Sometimes it was great, setting up interesting events, ideas, and character moments, but at other times people were making the most irrational decisions just because it was what the character was written to do. To compensate for this poor writing at times, the actors picked up the slack and really tried their best to pick up the slack and tried to make every scene and line engaging, Daisy Ridley especially. Based on the trailer I was expecting more of an action movie, but this movie is more of a thriller, with most/all of the action taking place during the last 15-20 minutes of the movie. The action wasn’t anything I had seen before, but it was well shot, well choreographed, and well acted. One of the best ways I saw this movie described online was “Die Hard Lite,” or a movie heavily inspired by Die Hard but not nearly as good, and I would second that description. 


**Rating:**
3/5
