**Short Reivew:**
Like everyone knows, most/all the Karate Kid movies are quite similar in story/plot/structure, having them all end up being very predictable. Because of this, I was hoping the movie would keep the same core/heart of the originals, but I was hoping it would try to be unique, which is where this movie ultimately ran flat for me. There were subplots in the middle of the movie, but they were not good or unique enough. While these subplots were still mostly enjoyable, they didn’t wow me. The still felt a little cliche and made me wish the writers could have found a more unique angle for the movie. They also took up a majority of the movie, so by the time training and the fighting had to take place it all felt rushed, anticlimactic, and somewhat unsatisfying. 

Overall, despite my issues with the movie, all Karate Kid movies are still quite fun, including this one. The best thing I can say about this movie is that it’s enjoyable enough. It has the classic training montages, the classic fights, and the classic underdog story of the other movies. Ben Wang, Jackie Chan, and Ralph Machio have a wonderful dynamic together, and they always bring a wonderful sense of nostalgia throughout the film. I just wish the story was more focused, having less subplots through the middle and more training and tournament fighting throughout the movie. If you’re a fan of the other movies, this one won’t blow you away, but it’s still enjoyable to watch.


**Rating:**
3/5
