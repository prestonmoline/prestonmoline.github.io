**Short Review:**
This is a good movie! I’m sad that Disney didn’t even try to promote this movie. It tells a great story of an inspirational woman who was willing to sacrifice everything to defy all the odds. The shots were beautiful, the acting is great, and the score is inspiring. It’s not trying to be the best historical film ever made, but it does a wonderful job at telling a story and keeping your attention. I just wish they would have dove deeper into what truly motivated Trudy to fight for her success despite all the backlash. Overall, I think this is a great date night movie, especially since it’s streaming on Disney+ already.

**Rating:**
4/5
