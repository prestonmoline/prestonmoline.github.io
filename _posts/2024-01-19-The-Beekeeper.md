**The Good:**
Just like most Jason Statham movies, this one is full of fun, colorful, and full of crazy action. While the plot for the movie is a little too cheesy and simple, the action enabled this movie to be better than it  is on the surface. I loved seeing Statham take out a whole room of guys single handed in a night club-esque call center and blowing up a different call center at the beginning. I also loved the ending action scene where Statham had to sneak into the president’s mansion and fight his way to Josh Hutcherson’s character to finish him off. All of these scenes were well shot and choreographed, being extremely fun to watch.

I also loved Josh Hutherson in this movie. He played such a charismatic and energetic villain. I loved how he was a scammer, making the plot/story a little more modern. I loved how he was able to make the villain stand out as much as the action. Every line delivery of his was just so enjoyable, I wanted to see his character even more on screen. I also need Josh Hutcherson in more movies. He is great.


**The Meh:**
While the action was great, the story was just average. While I loved how the propulsion to the story was how a lady got scammed, it was literally just that simple. She was scammed, and then Jason Statham had to get revenge. I don’t think it needed to be any more complex than that, but I’m thinking some people wish there was more to the plot than that. 

In addition, I think there should have been more people who could stand toe-to-toe with Statham’s character. I understand that Statham’s character is supposed to be one of the best prior agents ever for the Beekeepers, but there was really nobody who could stand toe to toe with him, making a fight seem difficult, until the end of the film. There was even another Beekeeper called, and she was easily taken out. I think a little more tension in the story could have built up if the difficult level of some of the fights/action was increased. This could have made every victory even more satisfactory and the eventual downfall of Hutcherson’s character even more satisfactory.


**Overall:**
This movie is exactly for what you expect it to be - a Jason Statham action movie that is only wanting to show off how cool action movies can be. It’s no John Wick, but I’m glad it’s not, and it is a lot of fun to watch


**Rating:**
4/5
