**Short Review:**
This is a good, simple, wholesome movie for the family. I’m relatively new to the Paddington movies, having only seen the 1st movie prior to watching this. While I liked what I’ve watched, I struggle with these movies a bit because I’m so used to kids movies (PG movies) are excessively funny and unserious, but these movies are more serious with a bit of silly in them. I love how this movie is always focusing on teaching good lessons, being kind, and exploring new things, but all of this also makes it inherently difficult for me as an adult to fully enjoy since everything is supposed to be quite simple and straightforward for kids. Despite my struggles with the movies as an adult, I think Paddington in Peru is as good as the 1st movie, maybe a little better, and I think kids will absolutely love this movie, especially if they’ve enjoyed the other ones.


**Rating:**
3/5
