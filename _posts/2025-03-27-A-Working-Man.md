**Short Review:**
This movie is exactly what you’d expect it to be from the trailers. Even though it’s based on a book, it still feels quite derivative of Taken. While the story and execution of Taken is much better, the action in A Working Man is substantially better. As for the story, where this movie struggles compared to other Jason Statham movies, is they try to make this one very serious. His movies have this inherent dry humor baked in all throughout, so when those moments occur they take away from the serious nature of the film. As for the action, it’s as Jason Statham-y as it gets - over the top, very excessive, and very fun.

If you love Jason Statham movies, you’ll love this one, even with its flaws. It’s an enjoyable watch, and you’ll see exactly what you expect. 


**Rating:**
3.5/5
