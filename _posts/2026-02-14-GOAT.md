**Short Review:**
Not being a huge basketball fan, I ended up enjoying this much more than I originally anticipated.While the dialogue and story are both cliche and clunky at times, the basketball action was a lot of fun and very visually fun. They sadly make most of the basketball games you see very small, selective snippets of the whole game, but they do a great job at allowing each character and each player to have their time to shine on the court. This movie was written for and made for kids, but since the same studio who did the Spiderverse movies and K-pop Demon Hunters animated this one as well, so adults especially will greatly appreciate the artistic flares and animation used throughout the movie. I saw this with my 13 year-old cousin and he absolutely adored this movie, saying it was one of his favorite movies I’ve ever taken him to. Because of this, I can confidently recommend this for all kids up to the age of 13, even if they aren’t basketball fans. There’s enough style and substance to make this movie enjoyable.


**Rating:**
3.5/5
