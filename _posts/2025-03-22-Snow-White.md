**Short Review:**
I still don’t know why they decided to remake this. The original movie did come out nearly 80 years ago, so they should have improved everything about the movie, which didn’t happen. Rachel Zegler sings great and the new songs are significantly better than the other live action remakes, but the movie really struggles to keep you engaged. Snow White and her love interest have no chemistry, most of the acting is bland, and everything just speaks “we didn’t know the best way to remake this movie.” The movie is watchable but it’s not super enjoyable. If you are interested in it, I’d give it a watch. If not, I’d wait until it’s on Disney Plus.


**Rating:**
2.5/5
