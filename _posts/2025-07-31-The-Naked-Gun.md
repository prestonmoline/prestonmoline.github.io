**Review:**
What a hilarious movie. This is definitely the funniest movie I’ve seen this year, perhaps years. If you’ve seen the original Naked Gun movies, you’ll know that what makes this movie so good is that it is able to have the main actor (Liam Neeson) act so serious while the dialogue, the situations, and the story are comedic. By doing so, you get this dry humor that is played as serious and is absolutely hilarious. Liam Neeson does an amazing job at delivering his lines so straight despite how ludicrous they may be. The only parts of the movie that fall a little flat and are just okay are the story, which is expected in this kind of movie, and the consistency of the humor, which can be a little hit or miss at points. Despite that, it still is just so much fun to watch since the whole purpose of the movie is to just make you laugh, which it does a fantastic job at doing. If you’re wanting to watch a care-free comedy that is only trying its hardest to make you laugh, I’d highly recommend watching this. (Please just go watch it, we need more good comedies).

**Rating:**
4/5
