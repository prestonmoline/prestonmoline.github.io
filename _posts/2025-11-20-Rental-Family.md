**Review:**
I wish I had a lot to say about this movie, but to be brief, it is wonderful. The whole premise of the movie is that there is an American, Phillip (Brendan Fraser), who lives in Japan who is attempting to be an actor. He comes across this agency, Rental Family, who rents the services of people, whether it be a friend to play video games with, someone to talk to, a brother, a sister, a father, a mother, etc, allowing Phillip to perform his acting with real people in authentic, unique circumstances. Phillip, being a white guy in Japan, ends up being this token white man that people want services from. 

What makes the movie so special is that throughout the movie Phillip is making these meaningful connections and relationships with the people he is working for and with, and it’s these relationships that made the movie resonated so much with me. While I’ve been blessed to have wonderful friends in my life, never having to pay for someone to fill a role in my life, it was beautiful to see how life really can change when someone comes into our life who gives us meaning, hope, attention, care, and love. It made me appreciate the relationships and friendships I have and how I shouldn’t take them for granted, and I think any movie that can have that kind of emotional impact on anyone is definitely worth the watch. Also, if you’re a big Brendan Fraser fan, you’ll also absolutely adore his performance as Phillip.


**Rating:**
4.5/5
