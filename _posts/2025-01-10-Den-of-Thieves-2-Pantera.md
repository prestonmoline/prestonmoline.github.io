**Short Review:**
I think this is a good sequel to the 2018 Den of Thieves movie. RIght off the bat I initially started enjoying the movie just based on the way the movie was shot. Most, if not all, of the movie was shot on location (in the Canary Islands), making every shot look absolutely beautiful. In addition to the beautiful shots, this movie has a significant increase in the heisting compared to the original, which was awesome, but there was significantly less action, which was extremely disappointing. Because of the increase of the heisting, the entire first half of the movie was a little slow, but it made the heist at the end very enjoyable and very satisfying. Overall, this movie is very fun, but it does take a while to get going, and I was missing the action. If you enjoyed the first movie, youâ€™ll probably enjoy this one.



**Rating:**
3.5/5
