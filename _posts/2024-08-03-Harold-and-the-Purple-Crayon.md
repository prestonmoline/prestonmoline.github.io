**Short Review:**
This movie is extremely underwhelming , especially as an adult, and wasn’t that entertaining. The film decided to have Harold be an adult and put him through a midlife crisis, which wasn’t super interesting at all, and there weren’t any really funny moments in the film.  The movie is very much for kids and catered for kids, and unlike other PG movies, it doesn’t even give the adults a good joke here or there. It seems that the movie was made just to have a movie made about the book. All of this being said, my little cousin Max loved the movie and said it’s one of the best new PG movies of the year, and I’ve taken him to almost all of the new PG releases. So, Kids will probably enjoy this movie. 


**Rating:**
2/5
(Max’s love of the movie is the only reason I’m rating it this high. It's more of a 1/5 or 1.5/5)
