**The Good:**
The animation and music in the movie were fantastic. I have never seen a Trolls movie before this one, and, even as an adult, I thought the music was very fun. I saw this with my little cousin, and he couldn't stop humming the songs from the movie afterwards. 


Additionally, the plot was actually quite fun. I thought the plot coming into the movie was going to be very simple and a little boring, but I was surprised about how much it hit home for me. The whole idea of reuniting a family to help one of your siblings is a bit cliche, but it worked for me in this instance since it was actually well executed. There was great dialogue between the brothers, and it made the movie go from very average to pretty good! 


From an overall entertaining perspective, this movie lands a home run. There wasn't a single kid or adult in my theater who wasn't invested in what was going on. I heard cheering, singing, and laughter all throughout the movie, including from my cousin. I always love it when a movie can fully engage the entire audience.


**The Meh:**
I do love puns and clever writing, but there were points where I was being bombarded by that kind of writing. It was fun the first time, but the more the puns and references kept coming up I kind of got tired of hearing them. I don't want to keep hearing puns about the names of different boy bands.


**The Bad:**
There were points where emotions were high and tense, and instead of trying to play that out even more to try to make an emotionally sound point, the movie would just stop and turn to song. I know that this can land for a few people, but right when the singing started, I was taken right out of the movie and the emotions it was trying to bring. I really wish they could have completed certain sequences and then move to a song. For me, this could have allowed the emotional and serious scenes to all be played out naturally, and then a song could have come in to double down on what had just happened.


**Overall:**
Despite having never seen a Trolls movie before, I found this movie very engaging, even for someone in their mid-twenties like me. I thought I was going to be bored by the music and the story, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I was actually enjoying what I was seeing. I also loved the animation. The way everything and everyone was animated really showed me how much care and love these movies are made with.


**Rating:**
4/5
