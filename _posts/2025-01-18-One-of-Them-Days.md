**Short Review:**
This is a great example of a movie that I really had no interest in but ending up having some fun with it. This movie is quite funny at times, but the movie was a little all over the place with its plot (for the best and the worst). Since the movie is about two girl best friends struggling through a tough day, the movie was definitely made for the ladies, so my wife quite enjoyed it. It wasnâ€™t fully my cup of tea, but with the humor scattered throughout, I ended up having a fun time watching it.


**Rating:***
3/5
