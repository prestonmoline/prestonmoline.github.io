**Short Review:**
I had a lot of fun watching this one. It was quite funny, and the story was great. I did miss the Furious 5, but I think the film was still worked well without them. This is probably the worst Kung Fu Panda movie, but that doesnâ€™t mean it's actually a bad movie. The other 3 are basically perfect movies that are much more memorable, so they are very difficult to compete with. I would still recommend you watch this one if you like the first 3 movies.

**Rating:**
4/5
