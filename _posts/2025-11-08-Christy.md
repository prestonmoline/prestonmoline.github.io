**Short Review:**
I think this is a fantastic movie that is not going to get as much praise as it should. Not only is the story extremely personal and incredibly devastating, the movie did a fantastic job of melding the personal story with fun, competitive boxing. Sydney Sweeney does a great job embodying Christy Martin, and Ben Foster did an incredible job playing Jim. I’d highly recommend watching this if you are a fan of sports biopics as it was extremely interesting and it was actually a story worth telling. I’d also recommend watching knowing little about Christy’s story. The less you know the more insane and interesting her story will be.


**Rating:**
4.5/5
