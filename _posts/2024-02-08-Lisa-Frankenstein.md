**Short Review:**
This was not my kind of movie. I thought the premise of the movie was a little dumb, and I didn’t care for the story that much either. Even though I didn’t care for it, my wife loved it and thought it was super fun. I'm glad I saw it with her, but I don't think I'll be watching this one again.

**Rating:**
2.5/5
