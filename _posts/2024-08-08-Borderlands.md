**Short Review:**
This is the epitome of an average movie. The talent in the movie is astronomical, but the end result was very underwhelming. The set pieces were great, the action was fun, but the plot is just spoonfed to you. Everything in the movie just happens because it is supposed to happen, and the movie also does it in a way where it takes no time to explain much, no real time to backstory or explanation, and no real time to even process what is happening. You see only how the characters get from A to Z, and that’s it. There was so much room for worldbuilding, character backstory, character development, and even character relationship building, and if the movie had decided to have that be a part of the finished product it could have been so much better. Jack Black carried the movie, and without him it wouldn’t be as good as it is (which isn’t even that good). If you are wanting to turn your brain off during a movie and just enjoy what you are watching, this may be a movie for you. It’s a harmless movie to watch, but it could have been so much better.For being a movie about a video game, it doesn't even interest me in the game at all.


**Rating:**
2.5/5
