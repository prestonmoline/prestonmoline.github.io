**Short Review:**
I know this movie is a little divisive, but I really enjoyed this movie. I loved how it was all over the place, full of surprises and plot twists, and how the film didnâ€™t take itself too seriously. Some people may say the movie was a little too silly or stupid at times. While that may be true, I still greatly enjoyed the silly/stupid momements. I also loved Sam Rockwell in the movie. He was so fun to watch, and he always had me smiling or laughing. I do think the end dragged out a little long, but besides that I had a lot of fun watching it. I think this will be a great one to watch again.

**Rating:**
4.5/5
