**Review:**
This is basically the same move as the other two, for better and for worse. The movie looks absolutely flawless, but the story and the writing is simple and laughable at times. I did enjoy watching the movie, but there’s only so much enjoyment you can have during a 3+ hour movie that you’ve basically seen before. If you’re a fan of the other movies you’ll love this one, but I just want the franchise to evolve instead of being the same every movie.

**Rating:**
3/5
