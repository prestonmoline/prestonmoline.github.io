**The Good:**
Dreamworks has been crushing it the last few years, and this film elevates the studio to another level. This movie has more breathtaking animation that I didn’t want to stop watching. It seems that Dreamworks has been improving its animation over the years, as seen in Puss in Boots the Last Wish and now in this film. Since this movie is based on a book, they made each frame of the movie feel like it came right out of a book and brought the world to life perfectly.

While we haven’t read the book, my wife and I absolutely fell in love with the story. The movie is a story about a robot (Roz) who ends up having to become the mom to a goose runt (Brightbeak) after becoming stranded on an island full of animals.  The relationship between these 2 and Fink the fox were superb. Fink is an outcast who nobody likes, and these 3 characters were able to come together and become their own family, mend relationships with all the animals on the island, and also be able to help Brightbeak become the goose he was never supposed to become (since he was the runt). By the end of the movie you will love the characters and will want to spend more time with them.

The humor in the movie was also so good. Most of the jokes were death related (said by kids, making it really funny), but every time there was a joke my wife and I had a good laugh. What was also nice about the jokes is that none of them innuendos or crude references (i.e., “PG” jokes that were just for adults). It was so refreshing to go to a PG movie that was written in mind for all audiences and is actually appropriate for children.

**The Meh:**
Throughout the last 30 minutes of the film, there were several instances where my wife and I both thought that the movie was just about to end, but it just kept going. We both highly enjoyed where the story kept going and how the story kept evolving and resolving further, but it did really make the movie feel longer than it actually is. 


**Overall:**
This is the perfect blend of gorgeous Dreamworks animation with a beautiful story about family and friends that reminds me of the Disney greats. This is a movie that everyone will enjoy, and this will go down as one of Dreamworks’ best movies yet.


**Rating:**
4.5/5
