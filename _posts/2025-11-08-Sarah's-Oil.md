**Review:**
I was only aware of this movie due to the fact that my work did the film incentive work on this film, so I thought I would support the film and watch it. Prior to watching the movie I had seen the trailer for it a few times, and it looked like it was going to be a simple, Angel Studios-esque movie about the struggles of African Americans post-Civil War to economically succeed around the oil rush, along with having underlying themes of faith throughout. That ended up being exactly what it was. The movie competently made, it was shot well on location, but the main holdup of the enjoyability of the film is the script. This movie is a child-centered movie, so much of the plot and dialogue had to be simplified so it could be ingested and understood by young kids (hence the PG rating), which ended up making the movie a little too predictable too. Despite being for young audiences, it was a cute enough movie that told a story about an interesting time in America about experiences I never knew had taken place. If you have young kids and you’re interested in showing them a movie that teaches them about a unique time of American history, I’d definitely recommend giving this a watch. While the movie is exactly what the filmmakers wanted it to be, I just wish it was a little more engaging and entertaining for adults.

**Rating:**
3/5 (nearly a 2.5/5)
