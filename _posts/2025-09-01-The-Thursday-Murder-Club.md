**Short Review:**
This is a simple and good enough murder mystery movie. The story is nothing really special, but I always love how they were able to get several of the old acting legends together in a single movie. It’s a simple story of a group of old people at a retirement facility (the Thursday Murder Club) that injected themselves in a police investigation. The movie is funny at times, and has a few twists and turns, but it is also quite predictable. Out of all of the new streaming movies this one is harmless and an easy watch. It won’t be your favorite movie and it’s not super special, but it’s one that you won’t regret putting on, especially if you need a decent movie on in the background.


**Rating:**
3/5
