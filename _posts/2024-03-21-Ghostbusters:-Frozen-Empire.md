**The Good:**
What was great about this movie, just like the other Ghostbusters movies, was the comedy. Paul Rudd, Patton Oswald, and Kumail Nanjiani were standouts. They made every scene they were in so much more lively and fun. The film wouldn’t have been as enjoyable without them. 

I love how the story, just like Afterlife, focuses on the family. I think keeping a focus on the family helps allow the story to get serious at times, allowing for more emotions to be present and felt than in a traditional comedy. 


**The Meh:**
One of my main issues with the movie is that while the premise of a frozen empire is an awesome idea for ghostbusters, it’s not even present that much in the movie. Yeah, the movie spends a lot of its runtime building up to it, but once the frozen empire comes (through Garraka) and is released upon the world, it doesn’t last that long, making it underwhelming. I wish they could have found a way to expand the frozen empire scenes or initiate them earlier in the movie. By doing so, the threat of Garraka could have felt significantly more overwhelming, allowing for more tension to be built up prior to the finale. While I did like how Garraka was eventually brought down, I think with even more tension and buildup than there actually was in the movie, the resolution could have been more satisfactory. 


**The Bad:**
While there isn't anything really bad about the movie, the underwhelming nature of the story really took a toll on the overall enjoyability of the film.


**Overall:**
This is one of the most unique films I have ever seen. It was able to tell an action-packed story of regret, longing, and revenge that was very good. The action/fighting is very graphic, so this is not for those who get a little squeamish with blood. It is a movie Dev Patel should be very proud of, and it’s one I would love to watch again.


**Rating:**
3.5/5
