**The Good:**
Michael Keaton is fantastic as you would expect. His over the top acting, his extreme line delivery, and his overall presence as a character was just perfect. He is just as manic as ever. His performance and the remaining cast’s performances are definitely aided by the script though. The writing in the movie is extremely well done and wittiy, and the characters are written in a way to have more realistic emotions and conversations with each other. You can definitely tell that they spent years writing and trying to get the perfect script. 

When it comes to being transported to the world of Beetlejuice, the sets and the practical effects are awesome. The story really goes all over the place (in a good and very enjoyable way), and Tim Burton does an incredible job at blending both realism and the unrealistic. The crazy sets and the fun characters (like Bob and Willem Defoe’s character Wolf Jackson) make the Afterlife come to life and make it feel so unique compared to other renditions of the afterlife. The movie feels and looks like a movie made in the late 80’s with today’s modernity too.


**The Meh:**
While I love how crazy the story goes, there are certain parts of it that weren’t expounded enough or just ended abruptly. With the character of Delores (Monica Bellucci), her character had the ability to feel and appear so much more menacing/scary if she could have had more time on screen, especially with Beetlejuice. She has such terrifying powers, but she never really uses them in a menacing way to frighten our main characters. As for the character of Jeremy (Arthur Conti), his and Astrid’s (Jenna Ortega) story could have been longer and could have allowed for even more emotional reconciliation between Astrid and her mom (Winona Ryder). 


**Overall:**
This movie is a ton of fun to watch. I had little-to-no expectations when walking in (I was expecting to be a little disappointed to be honest), and it ended up being one of my favorite movies to watch this year. I do think there was some room for using some of the characters a little more, but that never truly detracted or how much I was enjoying the film. If you enjoy the original, you’ll definitely enjoy this one. This is definitely a worthy sequel.


**Rating:**
4.5/5
