**Review:**
I’m extremely conflicted about this movie. This movie has some of the funniest moments and scenes in a movie I’ve seen this year and this last decade, but I thought the movie and story as a whole was lacking and quite boring at times. You have two fantastic actors, Tim Robinson and Paul Rudd, who carry this movie in all its comedic moments, but once you have to make sense of a story between various skits that are taking place this movie starts to fall apart. There is a semblance of a story throughout, like trying to develop a friendship, but the story goes all over the place that at times it even loses sense of this idea.

Despite the story and pacing issues, this movie had some of the most fun and unique editing I’ve seen in a movie this year. It’s done in a way that seems way cheesy, but it really works at bringing out additional humor in certain scenes. And as for the humor, it is exactly what you expect from a Tim Robinson movie/skit. It’s out of pocket, random, and funny as can be, exactly like you’d expect.

Overall, this movie struggles as a whole to be/feel like a credible and good movie, but individual moments and scenes are absolutely fantastic and hilarious. If there could have been a better through line for the plot throughout the movie this movie could have been an absolute homerun, but if you love Tim Robinson and his work, you’ll most likely absolutely love how quirky, weird, random, and disjointed this movie is.


**Rating:**
3/5
