**Short Review:**
While there were funny moments, the movie is never consistent, is all over the place with its humor, and always like the story, the pacing, and the jokes are meant for the youngest watcher. I get the movie is based on a book for young kids, but it feels like the movie doesn't live up to its potential and alienates its entire audience (my cousin for example loved the books when he first read them several year ago) and made them not enjoy the movie whatsoever. The movies only saving graces are the animation, which was quite good, Pete Davidsonâ€™s voice acting, and the random one-liners that happened to land every once and a while.


**Rating:**
1.5/5/5
