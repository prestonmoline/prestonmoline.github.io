**The Good:**
Upon the opening and start of the movie, you are harassed with comedy like you will never see, and it never stops throughout the runtime of the movie. What makes it better is that most of the jokes not only land but are genuinely hilarious. You will be laughing throughout the whole movie, and I will warn you that your mouth may be sore from smiling and laughing so much. While the humor is absolutely there and on point, the music also brings in additional gravitas to the scenes that elevates them to the next level, making them so much better than they had any right to be. As for the jokes, some of the jokes are just jokes, some are very meta references that are hilarious, and some are 4th wall breaks. Just as a note, the very meta references can be very obscure, so the more Marvel you have watched (not just MCU) and heard about in the news, the funnier they get. The same goes with the 4th wall breaks.

In conjunction with the humor and comedy, the action doesn’t let you down either. While most of the action occurs in chunks, when it happens the scenes are long, violent, brutal, bloody, and extremely well choreographed. Every instance of action always made me grin with how good it looked and how fluid the choreography was. The action scenes were some of the best in the entire MCU. 

As much as I can praise the humor and action, none of that would be possible without the 2 leads of the movie - Hugh Jackman and Deadpool (I mean Ryan Reynolds). Both of them play their characters so effortlessly, it really feels that their scenes are comic book pages come to life. Their banter is hilarious, and their relationship is unique to say the least. I’m so glad that we actually had a proper movie to have these 2 characters together and have them deliver something amazing.

Another thing that I really love about this movie is how much fun and creativity the entire production had. I know that some people have been disappointed by recent Marvel movies, and it seems that some of them haven’t taken any risks. This movie is not that. This movie does whatever it wants, despite its flaws. The creatives behind the movie made the exact movie they wanted to, and since they had a clear vision of what they wanted to make its execution is nearly flawless.

Note - there are several cameos in this movie (which I will not spoil here). They are wonderful additions to the movie. What I loved about them is that they actually were integral to the progression of the story instead of just being used for like 5 seconds of jokes. Get excited to have your mind blown.

As another note, I didn’t see any issues with the CGI. I think all of it looked pretty great to me.


**The Meh:**
To me, the only thing that held this movie back from perfection was that it basically abandoned the plot and the desire for actual character development partially through the movie. I understand that both of those points were not the main point of the movie (which was literally just to be a comedy and make you laugh), I still wish there was more. I think they could have spent like 2-5 more minutes to put in some additional moments for plot/character development. If they would have done that, this movie would have easily not only been the best movie I have seen this year, it would have been one of the best comic book movies ever made.

Another VERY small “issue” I had is that it seems like they slightly dulled the overall color pallet of the movie over time. I remember the first trailer had everything looking so vibrant and bright. While that is still mostly the case, I just wish that they would have kept the exact color tone of the first trailer. I know it is just something I would have wanted, but I also know that the finished product still looks amazing and is incredible.


**Overall:**
This is easily the funniest movie of the year. I had a smile on my face the whole time, and I never wanted the movie to end. After all that Marvel has been through the last few years, this shows how good their movies can and should be.  I can’t wait to watch this again on Saturday.


**Rating:**
4.75/5
