**Short Review:**
This is a pretty good action/thriller. Aaron Pierre (Terry) does an incredible job playing a quiet, humble, and thoughtful ex-Marine. He’s also built very well, allowing him to do some incredible action in the film. As for the action, it was pretty great overall, especially near the end. Aaron Pierre gets very physical and does combat in a way I’ve never seen before. What the film struggles with at times is pacing. Movies that take their time to get through the movies can be extremely enjoyable, but with this film it really feels as if the movie is structured in 3 distinctive parts: the setup, the failure, the revenge/resolution. Each part is good in its own way, but the beginning of each part took their time to push the story along, letting the pacing struggle at times and leaving me occasionally confused and a little bored. If you like action/thrillers based on revenge, you’ll definitely enjoy this movie, especially if you thought the trailer was interesting. It’s much better than nearly every other Netflix original movie.



**Rating:**
3.5/5
