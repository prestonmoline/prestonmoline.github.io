**Short Review:**
This is a very difficult movie to review. In regards to the acting, the visuals, the aesthetic, and the sound design, everything was incredible. I saw online that most of the creatures in the film were animatronics and were actually being puppeted on set. On screen, these creatures look incredible, and it’s a testament to how good practical effects can be. On the other hand, this is not the kind of movie that I enjoy. Intense thriller/horror movies like this struggle to entertain me. I know what I saw will really be exactly what people want to watch, especially if you’ve enjoyed other Alien movies, but I could never find myself getting invested in the movie whatsoever. In addition, when I think of an intense thriller/horror movie, I think of A Quiet Place. I much prefer those movies over this because that movie is able to establish an emotional core and to the film that Alien Romulus struggles to. I find that connecting with a family wanting to stay together is easier than connecting with kids who are trying to escape indentured servitude (this movie).


**Rating:**
3.5/5
