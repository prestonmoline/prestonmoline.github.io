**Short Review:**
The Alto Knights tells the story of the Italian mob, mobsters, and gangsters, and what led to their eventual downfall. This is such a unique part of American history that most don’t know about and won’t unless they decide to research it or watch this movie, which is exactly why I wanted to see this movie. This movie is long and its pacing is very slow, but it dives right into what the individuals involved in the mob would have been dealing with and what they were doing at the time everything is about to blow up. Due to the pacing, some scenes did feel very drawn out and other scenes felt unnecessary, but what really helped me stay drawn into the story despite this was the way in which the story is told. One of the characters Robert De Niro plays is Frank Costello, the head of the Italian mob, and he is telling the story as a complete retrospective on what occurred. Doing this made the story feel more alive, as if I was watching the actual Frank Costello recount and reenact the events that occurred.

I went into the movie knowing I wasn’t going to see the most entertaining movie, rather I went in to learn and to become a little more educated about certain events in history, and my expectations were absolutely met. I’d recommend this to anyone who is interested in learning about the events surrounding the downfall of the Italian mob.


**Rating:**
3.5/5
