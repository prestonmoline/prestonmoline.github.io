**Short Review:**
I think this movie is as good or better than the original. I think the story is a little more original, the action shots are awesome, and Jason Mamoa is as fun as ever. Him and Patrick Wilson are such a great duo. I just wish the last scene wasnâ€™t as cheesy as it was.


**Rating:**
4/5
