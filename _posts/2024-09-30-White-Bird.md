**Short Review:**
This is a cute story about a young Jewish girl during WWII learning compassion and falling in love, and itâ€™s also about learning to be and treating other better. Most of the charm of the movie does come from the great chemistry between the actors and the simple story that allows a lot of emotion to be felt. Being a PG-13 movie, I was expecting and hoping for a little more complexity and intensity from the movie, but in the end I was a little disappointed. Despite that, the film does a great job at showing the hardships that Jews had to go through at the time many of them went into hiding. I think this film is a good movie for a kid to watch to learn about the treatment of the Jews during WWII and can be a great (in addition to teaching them about kindness), but I think it falls a little flat for adult audiences who would want the stakes to be higher and the plot to be less predictable.


**Rating:**
3.5/5
