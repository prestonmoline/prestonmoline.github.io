**Short Review:**
This is a movie I like the idea of but did not care for the execution. The premise of the movie is that the main character, Nathan (Taron Egerton) pissed off some people in prison, so the day he comes out of jail they decide to hunt down and kill his ex-wife and her new husband for revenge and were trying to chase down his daughter to finish off the rest of his family. The only way for him to stop them from hunting him down is to try to eventually take down the head of the people he pissed off. This seems good enough on paper, but the writing of the movie was so poor, with some of the weakest/boring dialogue in a movie I’ve seen in a long time along with some really poor acting. I could never get fully invested in the story, and by the time you meet the big bad of the movie, he’s written to be overly cartoonish and cliche, having nothing interesting about him whatsoever. The only saving grace in the movie is the chemistry between Nathan and his daughter. Everything else is just passable to be in a multi-million dollar movie. Overall, if you see the trailer of the movie, along with the synopsis and find it interesting, you may end up enjoying the movie. I just kept on thinking the movie would pick up and actually get good, but it never really did for me. It’s very watchable, but it’s nothing special at all.


**Rating:**
2/5
