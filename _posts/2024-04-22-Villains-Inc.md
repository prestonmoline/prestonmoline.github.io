**The Good:**
The one main thing I really thought was good about the movie was its premise. It may be a simple idea to say that it's legal to be either a superhero or a super villain, but I think it’s an idea that really hasn’t been done before. I think there is a really good movie that could be made with that exact premise, but with the budget being as low as it was, there was no way that they could have made that kind of movie. With that, and despite being a low budget movie, you can tell the crew and cast tried their best to make a good, fun movie. 

I also thought Matt Meese as Megadeath was hilarious. I just wish he was in the movie even more.


**The Meh:**
The story in the movie is something that could have easily been improved. The whole premise of the movie is that everyone in the friend group wants to be super villains, but the story is just all over the place. They have all the characters jumping from place to place “just because,” and most moments are cut in with humor to just try and make the movie funnier. Sadly, only a few of the moments that are trying to be funny are actually funny.

As for the acting, it wasn’t bad, but it also wasn’t great. Most of the actors are significantly better at sketch comedy. This made some serious scenes fall flat because the performances were sub-par.



**The Bad:**
Since the movie is very low budget, most of the budget did not go into the visual effects. While they work, they definitely seem low effort and they are obviously not great.


**Overall:**
While the movie's concept is intriguing, its limited budget appears to have restrained its potential for greatness. Both the visual effects and the script could have benefited from additional resources and refinement. Despite that, there's an undeniable charm to the film that makes it decent for casual viewing, especially during late-night gatherings with friends. Personally, my fondness for the movie is partly due to its ties to the former cast of Studio C. Despite its flaws, it's not entirely devoid of entertainment value. The key lies in watching it with the right company.


**Rating:**
2.5/5
