**Short Review:**
This movie online is getting much more hate than it deserves. It’s definitely not the best movie ever made, but it’s definitely far from enjoyable. While being in a chair for 90% of the movie, Chris Pratt is able to do a great job at guiding the audience through the experience his character has gone through (being arrested and charged for the murder of his wife), while only having an hour and a half to prove his innocence. I loved the way his character had to interact with the AI, opening documents, watching videos, and discussing with an AI the various scenarios that could have taken place, having unique visual storytelling throughout the movie. While I do think the movie was a bit predictable, along with the movie trying a little too hard in the last 15 minutes to be the action movie we would really want it to be, I do think the movie was enjoyable and engaging enough to watch, especially if you can find it on a streaming service.


**Rating:**
3.5/5
