**Short Review:**
This is a great example of a movie that was shot well, great direction, and an interesting premise, but there were a lot of very weird decisions in between all of that. The idea of creating a movie of the hectic hour and a half before the first showing of Saturday Night Live (and the movie also basically being an hour and a half long before credits) is a super unique idea. The way the movie is shot has you going behind the scenes, following everyone around as they are trying to make sure everything can be functional the night of the premiere. On the other hand the characters aren’t relatable or pleasant at all (granted, it is Hollywood), and they don’t even make half of the original actors super interested to be in the show. I understand that some of the actors could have been second guessing the show, but having parts of the movie be about actors wondering why they were doing Saturday Night Live at all really made it hard to want the show to even succeed. You see how much passion Lorne Michaels has for the show, but you also see how much he has to deal with to even get the show made. Nobody wants him to succeed, and everyone in Hollywood that could have and should have supported him were just being awful. (The film also does a great job showing how terrible people in Hollywood can be, but that’s a different story). The only thing that made me enjoy the movie more than dislike it was who they really sold how improbable it was for the show to even succeed in the first place. Despite failure after failure, everything was able to come together by the end. Overall, I think this is a movie that only die-hard SNL fans will really love. It’s interesting to understand the struggles of the show getting made, but unless you love that era of the show and can catch all of the references, this movie won’t really work for you.


**Rating:**
3/5
