**Review:**
As movies this year have felt a little average, this one decides to do its best to be one of the best. Having seen the original only days ago, The Accountant 2 improved on the first in almost every way. It has more action; it has more brotherly fun/chaos; and it has better, more natural humor. The driving force of the improvement was the dynamic between John Bernthal and Ben Affleck on screen. They are both so much fun to watch (especially Bernthal), and they really make more of every scene they are in together. I’ve also seen some people online mention how the movie replaced some of the puzzle solving with more action. I would agree to an extent.  The puzzle/situation being solved is still the sole focus of the movie, being very intriguing, but I think the first movie gives this movie the runway to have more action. Instead of having to get to know the characters (like we did in the first movie), things can pick up from where they were naturally, and having the Accountant be less of an accountant and more of an action hero is where the 1st move ended. 



Overall, there was never a dull or boring scene in the movie, and I really couldn’t have asked for more. If you are a fan of the original, you’ll have a fantastic time with the sequel. I highly recommend it.

**Rating:**
4.5/5
