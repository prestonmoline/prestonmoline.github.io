**Review:**
While Netflix has been able to produce the best of the murder mystery movies (Knives Out), with another one coming later in the year, this is not one of those movies. Most murder mysteries are quite good based on the level of intrigue they bring along with the twist(s) it may have. While this was interesting at times, it didn’t do anything to truly hook me in and engage me. By the time I was almost getting hooked in and it was starting to get interesting, it decided to prematurely give you the twist and reveal everything. The movie is an hour and a half long, and the reveal takes place 50-55 minutes into the movie, having ⅓ of the movie left. Spilling the beans so early in the film wouldn’t have bothered me if the initial 50-55 minutes had me fully invested, but that never happened. Right when the movie was starting to get interesting it showed its hand, which ended up being another cliche twist with an underwhelming ending.

Overall, while the movie didn’t do anything I overtly disliked, I just wish it was more intriguing, had more interesting characters, and drew me in a lot more. The movie takes place on a very fancy yacht, so the film looked beautiful, and Keira Knightley did a fantastic job playing the lead, but those were the only strengths the movie had. I don’t think this is a movie a lot of people will care to watch, but (1) it is only an hour and a half long so it’s not too long of a watch, and (2) it’s the kind of movie to have on in the background to half-heartedly pay attention to. It’s just difficult to want to watch an ‘okay’ murder mystery when there are so many better ones out there to watch.


**Rating:**
2/5
