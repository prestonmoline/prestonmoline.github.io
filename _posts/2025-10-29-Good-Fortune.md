**Review:**
After seeing the first trailer for the movie I got super excited to see another comedy with Keanu Reeves that also happens to have Aziz Ansari and Seth Rogen. Based on the trailers I was really hoping to get a bunch of humor from Keanu being an angel along with a lot of laughs that would naturally come from a rich and poor person swapping lives, and to my surprise I got what I wanted, for better and for worse. The movie is stacked with humor from beginning to end, but where I thought I would find a lot of enjoyment from the story along with some great situational irony from a rich and poor person swapping lives I ended up finding it to be more preachy about rich people being terrible people. While I think there is a way to have competent discussions about the economic classes and capabilities of individuals, the movie felt more focused on demonizing the rich with very little grace and nuance. To me it just felt extremely ironic having very successful and wealthy people acting in a movie that was trying to make a point of how terrible people with wealth really are. 

Overall, I think the movie is a fun one-time watch. It has a ton of really funny moments, especially with Keanu Reeves, but it was the times in between the humor that really seemed to drag on with scenes that weren't as entertaining as I would have expected. If you found the trailers for this movie super entertaining I would recommend giving this a watch, as you’ll get the exact laughs out of the movie as you expect, especially from Keanu.


**Rating:**
3/5
