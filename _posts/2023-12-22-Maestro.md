**Short Review:**
This was probably one of the slowest and most tedious films I have ever watched. I watched it on a plane and I had to pause it a few times just to get through it. I thought there was nothing driving the plot and no real purpose for the movie shown. I understand this movie is a love letter to Bernstein, so I may have enjoyed it more if I would have known about and cared about Bernstein prior to seeing this movie. I would have given it a lower rating if it wasn’t just for Bradley Cooper’s extreme dedication to this role.

**Rating:**
1.5/5
