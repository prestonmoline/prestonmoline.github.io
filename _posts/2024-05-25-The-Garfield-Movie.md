**The Good:**
One of the major aspects of this movie is Garfield reconnecting with his long-lost father. I know some people may not want that from a movie about a cat who just usually eats lasagna, but I thought it was one of the better parts of the movie. I think they did a great job building the care, character, and love between the characters throughout the film. Throughout the movie there is a heist that everyone has to go on, and the way they had the characters interact, meet new people, and even finish the heist was very fun. While this is definitely a different take on the Garfield character in a Garfield movie, I really enjoyed what was delivered.

What helped me enjoy the film even more was the way they visualized action, motion, and humor. There would be times Garfield would be chatting it up with another character and Odie would be in the background doing his own thing, improving a situation or just making it funnier. Other times, the movie would make artistic references to other movies and pop culture, and the way that these were integrated throughout the movie always gave me a good laugh.

As another note, I know some people going to see this movie may not want to go because they are tired of Chris Pratt voice acting as everything and everyone. I can definitely tell you that I think he is a great Garfield. I really enjoyed what he did, and while watching the movie my cousin didn’t even realize it was Chris Pratt, and he loves Chris Pratt.


**The Meh:**
While I had a great time watching the movie, I think they dragged the end of the movie out a little too long. They had like 1 or 2 times where you thought the movie would be over, but it actually wasn’t. The scenes added didn’t add much to the movie either.


**Overall:**
Having never read any of the Garfield comic strips, I really enjoyed this film. It had a good balance of fun and heartfelt moments, and I loved how creative they were with the animation and the visual storytelling. I think this is a great movie for kids that most parents wouldn’t mind watching with them, and I think it is better than most people will say it is.


**Rating:**
4/5
