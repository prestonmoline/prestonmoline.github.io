**The Good:**
I know that seeing this movie a week and a half before it came out may slightly bias my thought, but I still think that this movie was pretty dang fun, and I think most of it is due to its super unique premise. I loved how they had the idea of a pretty simple rom com (having the two main leads be opposite personalities but eventually finding a connection) but based it all around NASA trying to get to space. While I can find rom coms to be pretty hit or miss, I found this to be much more enjoyable.

Having the premise of going to the moon, I was not disappointed by the set pieces in the movie. I felt like everything I was watching was taking place at NASA and its facilities, which really helped with the immersiveness of the story. Along with that, the main performances of Scarlet Johannsen and Channing Tatum really helped bring the story to life. I’ve seen a lot of movies with Scarlet Johannsen in them, and I think this is one of her best performances since The Prestige. She was extremely charismatic and fun, but when her character had a serious moment was able to show a different, more vulnerable side of the character that not many actresses may have been able to pull off.

As for other standouts in the movie, Woody Harrelson takes the top spot. I always have such a good time in movies he is in, and this one does not let down. Every scene he is in always made me laugh, and he brought so much life to a basically nameless character that I’m not sure any other actor could have matched his Woody Harrelson charm.

Another part of the movie I thoroughly enjoyed was the humor. I thought some of the jokes were very well written, and my whole theater had a ton of laugh out loud moments. My wife thought that some of the jokes seemed a little forced and not well acted, but I didn’t feel that, so maybe your experience will vary from mine.


**The Meh:**
The only thing that both me and my wife struggled with at times was the pacing. While we both think that the movie showed everything it needed to and wanted to, it felt like it would swap back and forth between character growth/interaction to story progression. I understand that both are needed, but it felt that right when momentum was being gained with characters of the movie, it would cut to start progressing just the story, or vice versa. By the end of the movie everything did come together, but throughout the movie all of the back and forth really made the film seem long. On the other hand, the times where both of these were happening at the same time were some of the best moments in the movie, but it wasn’t super frequent. 


**Overall:**
I think this is a super fun date night movie, and I think this is a movie that I wouldn’t mind seeing again with friends and family. It is a simple rom com with a very fun premise of being set around getting to the moon. There are a ton of good laughs, and I think the acting was great.  Almost everything in the movie was good/great, but nothing really stood out as incredible, which I think mainly stems from the pacing of the film. 


**Rating:**
4/5
