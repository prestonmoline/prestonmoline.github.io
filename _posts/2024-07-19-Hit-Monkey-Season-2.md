**The Good:**
I had a great time watching this season. I think the animation is spectacular, and the action is brutaI. Both are on par with the first season. I also love how they were able to give Bryce such an emotional journey trying to reconnect with his daughter throughout the season. Reconnecting is difficult, and I felt ample time was given to grow and develop a previously shattered relationship.

I also have to shout out Jason Sudeikis. I absolutely love him as Bryce. He is so witty and charismatic, but he is able to take to time to make the serious moments stand out and resonate.

**The Meh:**
One thing that I struggled to understand throughout the season was that Monkey was struggling to want to kill during the season. He would do it when necessary, but it was constantly brought up how he’s tired of killing and how it’s not what he wants to be doing all the time. While I definitely can understand how a character can feel like that and that they want to have a character have some growth, I think it became difficult to fully connect with because situations kept arising where Monkey had to kill despite not wanting to. 

I think that Monkey’s arc could have been more powerful if Monkey swore off killing, making it increasingly difficult to have him and Bryce get out of tough situations. Over time, Monkey could have come to the realization that sometimes it is necessary to do the dirty work for the greater good. I think by the end of the season the writers got there, but the way it was executed didn’t come together for me perfectly. (I’m also trying not to justify the amount of killing taking place in the show, but I think there was definitely a better way Monkey’s no-kill mid-life crisis could have been handled).

On top of it all, since Monkey was going through a no-kill crisis, it made the show a little less enjoyable for me at times because I just loved the unique ways the first season was able to show Monkey taking care of business. When he wasn’t doing that, I missed those crazy action scenes of the first season.

Another thing to note - the story in this season is a little less straight-forward and more supernatural than the first season. I didn’t mind it, but I know that some people may not like how different it can be at times.


**Overall:**
While I think this season is as good as the first, I don’t think it’s better than the original. I think that there are some incredible story moments in the season, but I think they missed the mark a little bit with Monkey’s characterization. I think there is so much more storywise that can be told, so I really hope they greenlight a 3rd season.

**Rating:**
4/5
