**Short Review:**
The best way I can describe The Unholy Trinity was that it was short, sweet, and to the point, for good and for bad. I loved how the movie kept a very tight narrative, rarely straying itself from the main plot of the movie, but what the movie lacked was well written dialogue and characters. The characters and their interactions all felt extremely cliche and predictable, so when dialogue was being said or decisions were being made, it was extremely easy to anticipate and guess what was going to happen and be said next, and Samuel Jackson, Pierce Brosnan, and Brandon Lessard were able to act well enough to distract me from several sub-par scenes. I'm 

What helped the movie stand out were the beautiful, scenic shots of the mountains of Montana. All of the movie was shot practically there, I loved how they gave time to show off the natural beauty of the area they shot at. Another standout was the main shootout at the end of the film. The director kept the camera man active, having him move from room to room, going with people as they were having the shootout, bringing life and energy into a movie that had predominantly remained slow and methodical throughout the movie. Having this shootout at the end, the film was also able to end and resolve in a much more satisfying way that I would have expected.

Overall, this film is enjoyable enough. It didnâ€™t do anything to reimagine a western or make a definitive western film, but it is still leagues better and more enjoyable than some of the other films I have seen this year.


**Rating:**
3/5
