**The Good:**
This is a visually beautiful film. The animators did such a good job bringing Cybertron to life, along with all of the wonderfully designed characters. The world is so fun and so unique, and the way it was portrayed made it an incredible template to show us the story of how Megatron and Optimus Prime became who they are, which story was extremely well told. 

The story is centered around Orion Pax (Optimus Prime) and D-1 (Megatron) before they become the characters we know them to be. Chris Hemsworth and Brian Tyree Henry do such an incredible job voicing these characters, and they bring as much passion and emotion to the characters that the voice actors in the past had done as well. With the story told, you really see and feel the devastation of best friends eventually becoming enemies, and the voice actors enable the story to be so impactful and poignant.

What this film also does so well with is the action. Since the movie is animated, the animators are able to show the Transformers fight in a way that we have never seen in live action. This action in conjunction with incredible animation and an action packed score from Brian Tyler, every action scene is just awesome.


**The Meh:**
The film was held back ever so slightly due to its PG rating. Since the movie is playing to all ages in the film (kids especially), there are some jokes that just don’t land and some dialogue that could have been stretched out and expanded. Most of the jokes were said by Keegan Michael Key, and a good chunk of them were also in the trailers for the movie, making them not be nearly as funny as they would have been if they wouldn’t have been shown previously. 


**Overall:**
While I still have a lot of love for the live action films, I think Transformers movies should be animated from now on. With animation there is infinite potential of story, visuals, and creativity, and I think this movie proves just this. This movie is very fun, and Transformers and non-Transformers fans alike will love this film.


**Rating:**
4.5/5
