**Review:**
What a wild adventure of a movie. The whole premise of the movie is that you have a girl (Rachel McAdams) who is stranded on an island with her terrible boss (Dylan O’Brian) after a terrible plane crash. While this may already seem like a generic and simple movie, Sam Raimi, the director, does such a wonderful job at creating this story that is not only engaging, but also becomes impossible to predict. By the end, you NEVER would have seen the ending coming. 

Because the movie is focused around 2 individuals, the movie as a whole could not have worked without the right actors. Rachel McAdams and Dylan O’Brian do an incredible job in this movie, really bringing each of the characters to life, with each of their strengths, flaws, and unique character traits. There was one scene in this movie that is so crazy, and all you see is Dylan O’Brian’s eyes, and he completely sells you on what is happening in that scene (if you’ve seen the movie you know exactly which scene I’m referring to). This movie would not have been the same without them, and they really made the movie as enjoyable as it could have been. 

If you’re wanting to watch a good thriller with the occasional jump scare, I’d highly recommend watching this.


**Rating:**
4/5
