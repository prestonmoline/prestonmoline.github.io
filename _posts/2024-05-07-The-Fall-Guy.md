**The Good:**
"The Fall Guy," directed by David Leitch, is a testament to the filmmaker's sklils, particularly evident in its breathtaking stunts and choreography. From car flips to boat chases, each sequence is executed with style, talent, and charm, showcasing Leitch's strengths. The mesmerizing stunts are not only impressive but also beautifully captured on screen. Long takes enhance the visual spectacle, while vibrant colors and well-designed costumes add to the film's appeal. The action sequence at the club, in particular, stands out for its use of color and choreography, elevating an already great scene to something truly remarkable

Music also plays a significant role, with tracks from artists like Phil Collins and Taylor Swift enhancing the overall experience. Their inclusion adds depth and emotion to key moments, enhancing the film's impact.
As for the acting, Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt are awesome. They really capture the “former lovers” trope exceptionally well, and they both bring comedy and realism to their characters, making them extremely relatable. Ryan Gosling also does an amazing job with his stunts. I need him to be in more action movies. And then there's Jason Momoa, whose performance is nothing short of incredible. I can only hope that he'll take on a more prominent role if the movie receives a sequel.
But what truly sets "The Fall Guy" apart is its homage to the unsung heroes of filmmaking—the men and women behind the scenes. It celebrates their contributions, making the movie a tribute to their hard work and dedication. The credits showcase behind-the-scenes footage, adding character to the movie and paying tribute to the stunt performers. It's a thoughtful touch that adds another layer of appreciation for the movie as a whole.



**The Meh:**
What I wish would have been a little better was the love story between Ryan Gosling’s character and Emily Blunt’s character. Throughout the film they are constantly talking about what good items they had together, but it never really shows what the good times are. During the film, most of the dialogue between the characters is about how they regret either doing or not doing something. While some of those scenes are very funny, I wish the script would have taken a little bit of time to get a little serious and help explain how or why everything was so good between the characters. If there could have been a little bit of understanding of what was really 


**The Bad:**
Nothing was bad about this movie!

**Overall:**
This is the perfect date night movie filled with action with romance. There is so much to love about the movie, whether it be the action, the characters, or even the actors themselves. Everyone in the movie is on their A-game, and this movie is definitely one of the stars of the year.


**Rating:**
4.5/5
