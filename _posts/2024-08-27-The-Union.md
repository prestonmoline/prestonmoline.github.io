**Short Review:**
This movie has the potential to be great, but it’s just not. The idea that a normal person could work for a secret government agency is fun, but the story and the writing don’t make the film engaging at all. You have Mark Wahlberg and Halle Berry trying their best as the leads to make something good, but even they can’t save the movie from extreme mediocrity. There’s nothing really driving the plot forward, no chemistry between the 2 main characters, and the motivations of the villain are boring and cliche. There are fun action sequences and car chases, but those are some of the movie’s only redeeming qualities. If you put the movie on, there’s no reason that you won’t just watch it because it’s on, but there’s nothing to get you invested in the story, and if you can’t get invested into an action/thriller, there’s no reason to really watch it.


**Rating:**
2/5
