**The Good:**
As expected the main highlight of this movie is the action. The choreography was spectacular, and I loved how they were able to allow the action sequences to use the set pieces around them - especially in the house. The sequences in the house (mainly the kitchen) were so unique, and the way they were shoot the action was incredible. 

The standouts of the movie are Ke Huy Quan and Marshawn Lynch. Ke effortlessly plays an action star and the movie would not be any good without his charisma and his acting capabilities, especially with the lackluster story. Additionally, Marshawn Lynch is just hilarious. He plays such a fun and eccentric villain, and his random comments are just hilarious. 

**The Bad:**
There are two major issues with the movie, and they both were issues in tandem. While the movie shined with its action and the creative ways the movie was shot, there was no focus with the story or the pacing of the movie. While the premise is simple, the story is only explained in the middle of the movie, and it absolutely ruins the pacing of the movie. The movie starts off so strong just setting up a simple movie that doesn’t need much more development, but they decided to try to make a much more in depth story, but it ended up being uninteresting and it completely screwed up the pacing of the movie. The beginning was so much fun, but the middle was such a slog. The end almost reached the heights of the beginning, but it could never come back.

**Overall:**
Despite the story and pacing issues, I had fun with this movie. This movie was just supposed to be made to be a fun action movie, and I enjoyed the action they showed and pleasantly surprised by how creative the choreography and the cinematography. If you enjoyed the trailers for the movie, you’ll definitely get a kick out of it, despite its flaws.

**Rating:**
3/5
