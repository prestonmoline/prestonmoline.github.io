**Review:**
To keep things brief, this is not a good movie. The premise of the movie can be generally interesting at times, but the overall story is uninteresting, poorly written, and the character motivations are as disinteresting as possible. The movie takes place in a post-apocalyptic Europe, having war torn factions making life a living hell. The main character (played by Dave Bautista) apparently is supposed to be a modern day Indiana Jones. He is requested to go from England to France to find the Mona Lisa, but instead of seeing him actually solve puzzles and adventuring/exploring, you just see him already know exactly where to go and somehow have the skills of John Wick and the strength of Drax the Destroyer combined to take out bad guys. There’s no emotionality to the film, the soundtrack doesn’t fit the vibe of the story, and the action is incredibly underwhelming. As such, I don’t recommend anyone watching this unless you are desperate to watch a bad movie.

And just if you are interested, the reason Dave’s character goes to France is to get a boat. A boat. Additionally, the Mona Lisa is actually not the Mona Lisa, it’s something else that’s so much dumber and not even a good plot twist (not going to spoil it).


**Rating:**
1/5
