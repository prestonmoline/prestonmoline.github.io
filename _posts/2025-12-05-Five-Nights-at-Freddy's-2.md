**Short Review:**
This is a franchise I have very limited experience with. I’ve maybe played 30-40 minutes of the games back in middle school, so the extent of my Freddy’s knowledge comes from very little time playing the game. That being said, the only thing I really remembered from the games is that besides trying to survive 5 nights, it really did a good job at trying to have just a hint of horror, really trying to jump scare you at times. I watched the first movie when it first came out, and while I thought the story was good enough, what I was disappointed in was how it wasn’t scary at all, having only 15-20 minutes at the end where it started to feel like the game. I have a little grace for the first movie as it’s just trying to introduce us to the world, the lore, and give us a tease at what is possible in the world, so with the second movie coming out I really had no expectations for the movie except that I wanted them to actually attempt to make it scarier. 

After watching the movie I can officially say they did a much better job at making the entire movie feel spooky and have those jump scares you would expect throughout. Where the movie lacks though is in its story and writing. This movie is all over the place with plot lines, characters, and locations, so it really didn’t feel like there was a central story really being told. On top of that, the way the dialogue between characters was written felt like someone wrote as fast as they could just to get words on paper, having most of the conversations have no purpose or make no sense in the context of the movie (it’s really not that good).

So, as a whole, the movie is just okay. My desire for the movie was to see if they actually could make it feel much more spooky like the game, which they did a pretty darn good job at doing. As a whole movie, it’s watchable, but it’s not a great overall movie. Since I went in just for the spooks, I came out more satisfied than I probably should have despite its flaws. If you are a fan of the series I have no doubt you’d have a good time with the movie (all the kids in my theater seemed to really enjoy it), but if you don’t know the games at all, I would pass on this movie as you will most likely not find it that enjoyable.


**Rating:**
3/5
