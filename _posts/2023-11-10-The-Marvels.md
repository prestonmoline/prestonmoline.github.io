**The Good:**
Compared to how the character was written/portrayed in the previous film, Carol Danvers actually felt like a real character with real desires and real motives. Because of this, I think the writers were able to make a character that was more endearing, likable, and fun.


Iman Vellani as Ms. Marvel is too good. She plays the role perfectly, and the way she interacts especially with her family is amazing. Most of the smiles I had while watching during the movie were because of something she had said, something she had done, or something funny one of her family members did or said.


The fighting choreography was amazing. Due to the fact that each of the Marvels was swapping places during the fights, the way they were able to get it shot, edited, and put together in a way that was enjoyable blows my mind. The way it was put together and the way each of the Marvels would work together to fight was a really unique and fresh way to put together a fight scene. 


The shorter run time of the film was also a delight. Some people may say the movie was rushed, but I think the movie had a brisk pace that allowed it not to sit in a dull moment at all. While this did make some scene transitions feel a little choppy at times, I think it was refreshing having a shorter super hero movie.


**The Meh:**
It was intriguing to see Dar-Benn find the other quantum band at the beginning of the movie, I think that was a weak way to introduce her. Throughout the course of the movie you find out that she is doing everything she is doing just for the survival of her people. I think they missed an opportunity to do a better introduction to the character. Since she is doing everything she can for her people, why not start the movie off with Hala, showing how desolate, destroyed, and terrible it is to live there. Dar-Been could meet with her people, mention at this moment that she is going to seek out a way to fix Hala and take revenge on "The Annihilator" (Captain Marvel) by wiping out the places and people she loves in the process. While all of these points were said/done throughout the course of the movie, if done at the beginning there could have been a greater understanding of what was driving her even more throughout the run time of the film.


**The Bad:**
While I thought Dar-Benn was a fine enough villain with a decent enough reason behind what she was doing, I felt that she was never really a threat at all during the movie. It seemed that she only kept getting away and "winning" because of stupid mistakes, not because she was just too overpowering.  Even in the final battle, she gets the second quantum band from Kamala because Carol decides to save her before taking of her quantum band. Because of this, it made each of the Marvels seem a little more incompetent while fighting instead of the powerhouses they are supposed to be.


**Overall:**
I think the Marvels was a significant improvement over Captain Marvel. With its brisk pace and fun action, there was a lot to enjoy throughout the whole movie. The writers also made Carol Danvers an enjoyable character now too! I think the way Dar-Benn was established as a villain was a little weak and they really didn't make her seem like a credible threat throughout the movie, but the performance of Zawe Ashton was fantastic. I think this movie needed another rewrite and another reshoot or two, but because of the Hollywood strikes this was unable to happen. Because of that, I think this is as good as a movie we could have gotten given the circumstances. I think a lot of people will have a good time watching this.


**Rating:**
4/5
