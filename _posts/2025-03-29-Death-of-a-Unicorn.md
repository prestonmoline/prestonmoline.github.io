**Short Review:**
This is one of the wackiest movies I have ever seen. The premise of the movie is simple and a little dumb, but if you buy into it the movie becomes quite enjoyable by the end. It takes quite a while for the story to pick up and be a little interesting, having the beginning of the movie focusing on the characters and doing lackluster character development. Once the Unicorn terror hits, itâ€™s relentless, ultra violent, and a whole lot of fun. 

Overall, I wish it could have been just a little bit better, especially the character development of Paul Rudd and Jenna Ortega characters. The writing was also poor at times, but the actors gave their all, especially Will Poulter (he was fantastic in this). 


**Rating:**
3/5
