**Short Review:**
This is one of the most unserious movies I’ve seen in a long time, and I had a pretty good time with it. The plot of the movie is simple and quite dumb, but it was the humor and the acting that really made this movie work. While I was wishing the humor would have been better at times, I can’t deny that the movie wouldn’t have been the same or as enjoyable without Jack Black and without Jason Mamoa, and you can tell they had so much fun filming this movie. You can obviously tell it’s a Jared Hess movie based on the fact there are so many tater tot references and that the characters are all from Idaho, and I was also surprised that the movie does a decent job at explaining the game and how the game worked throughout the course of the movie. 

Overall, parents will think the movie is a little too dumb, but kids will have a great time with this, especially if they’ve played the game.


**Rating:**
3/5
