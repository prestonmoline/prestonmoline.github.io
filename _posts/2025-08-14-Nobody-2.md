**Short Review:**
This is a good, but not great sequel. While it does a great job at following up the ending of the original movie, having Hutch right back in the action of taking out bad guys, the plot that follows is less original. The story feels like you could predict what was happening from a mile away, and the villains of the movie were crazy and over the top and cartoonish in performance (in a bad way). While the action was fun throughout, using the situationality of each to its advantage, by the end, I just wanted more originality and for it to have wowed me much more. Overall, the movie is good and enjoyable, I just wish it was as good as the original.


**Rating:**
3/5
