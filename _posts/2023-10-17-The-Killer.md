**The Good:**
Michael Fassbender is amazing. The way he portrays the killer is wonderful. He is methodical, he is despicable, and he is dedicated. Fassbender makes you feel as if he is a killer, and the way his narration of thoughts takes you through his process really helps you understand who the killer is, despite not even knowing his name.


During one of the scenes in Florida, the killer is trying to take revenge on one of the men who nearly killed is girlfriend. The fight sequence that ensues is raw, brutal, and extremely well designed. The way each character used the various parts of the house to their advantage was fantastic, and this may be one of the best fight sequences I've seen in a movie.


The score and sound design was fantastic. While subtle, the ambient sound of the soundtrack really made the film feel distinct and the actions of the killer feel poignant.


**The Meh:**
I know a lot of people enjoy a more slow and methodical story, but I think the opening scene was a little too long. Granted, it did show you the process of everything The Killer went through before doing his work, but I think they never really built up the necessity of him going through all of it. Granted, most of his thoughts are repeated throughout the movie, but I didn't feel like they showed the necessity of him following his regiment. It felt just like dialogue being voiced over that didn't have any response on the actions he actually took.


**The Bad:**
I enjoyed the experience, but I felt like there was no real climax of the movie. The feeling of a climax was the fight scene, but there was another 30+ minutes afterwards. The last discussion with the man who made the hit was like "don't come after me or I will brutally kill you." It wasn't super exciting as a resolution.


**Overall:**
I think the killer is a fine enough movie that has incredible acting and action, but on a story level is a little bland. I think there wonderful ideas put throughout the movie, but I think there was no real push or urgency with the plot, having everything seem cool on the outside, but hollow on the inside.


**Rating:**
3.5/5
