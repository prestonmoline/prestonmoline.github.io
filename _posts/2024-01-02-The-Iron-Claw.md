**The Good:**
I only saw this movie because I had heard it was incredible. By the time I walked out of the theater I was nearly in tears. The story is absolutely devastating, and the way it was portrayed within the film was absolutely miraculous.

I had never heard of the Von Erich family before watching the movie. The fact that this family went through so much, and the movie even cut out an entire brother just to keep the story a little simpler just blows my mind. 

Due to the consistent theme of brothers and brotherhood, I consistently was thinking about my brother. I was thinking about all of the good times and the bad times we had had together, and I also starting to think about what I would do if something happened to him. I have never had a movie pull me through an emotional roller coaster like that before. 

What helped the story be even more impactful was the acting. I know before this movie when I thought of Zac Effron I still only thought of High School Musical. Now I think of this. His performance was subtle, yet powerful, and extremely emotional. I really wish he would have received an Oscar nomination for his performance. Jeremy Allen White as Kerry and Holt McCallany playing the dad are also incredible. 

As a final praise, despite how devastating the story is, I loved how they showed all of the struggle and all of the trauma Kevin Von Erich went through. The fact they didn’t hold back really allowed the emotions to flow through to the audience, especially me personally. By showing everything, they could allow Zac Efron to act and emote perfectly without reservation. 


**Overall:**
One of the best movies I’ve ever seen, and I think everyone should watch it, especially if you have siblings. I genuinely cannot think of anything bad about the movie either. It is that good.


**Rating:**
5/5
