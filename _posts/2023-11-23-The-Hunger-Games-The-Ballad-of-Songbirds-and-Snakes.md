**Short Review:**
I think this is one of the better Hunger Games movies. While I liked the book (for the most part), I think this is one of the few instances where I much prefer the movie over the book. I think what really helped is the way the ending was able to be visually represented. What I also really enjoyed in this movie was the actual Hunger Games. Because this movie was less about showing the relationships of those fighting in the Games, they were able to show off more of the brutality of the Games more than they had in the previous movies. By doing so, you can fully see the transition from naive youth to an apathetic, power hungry manipulator. 

My only issue with the movie is also an issue with the book. After the Hunger Games are over, what comes after feels like a completely different story. If this were a TV show it wouldnâ€™t be that bad, being able to tell a long story over multiple episodes. Being a movie, it just seems like there are 2 movies taped together, the first part being about Snow helping Lucy succeed in the Games, the other being their life together afterwards. I just wish the bridge in between the two halves could have made the tone shift feel less drastic.


**Rating:**
4.5/5
