**The Good:**
Before going into this movie, I knew who Bob Marley was and 1 or 2 of his songs. Despite knowing very little, the film does a great job at introducing you to Bob, his music, and everything that was going on in Jamaica during his popularity. This enabled me to understand and develop an appreciation for the history that took place. Helping with that appreciation, shooting on location in Jamaica really helped bring Jamaica to life and feel like it also was a character within the movie.

I loved how much reverence they put into being honest and true to Bob’s story. Seeing the credits, I saw that the movie was produced by a lot of his children. This made it even more evident to me that they wanted the movie to feel as authentic as possible, which includes not shying away from some mistakes that he even made along the path of fame. Even though they were young when everything in the film took place, it doesn’t mean they don’t know what he did and why he was trying to accomplish.

I also loved the music throughout the movie. They did a great job fitting in songs from Bob Marley that fit the tone of the film during each scene. It helped his music come to life even more.

**The Meh:**
The film was mainly focused around one specific part of Bob Marley’s career - the Exodus album and performing peace concerts. I really wish they could have spent more time with Bob and his youth, showing what really drove him for his love of music, his aspirations and desires to be religious, and what drove him to really fight for peace with his music. I know some of these topics were referenced in the film, I just wish I had a more holistic view of his life in the movie than just a portion of his career.


**Overall:**
I think this is a good movie about Bob Marley and an aspect of his life that was very difficult for him and other Jamaicans, but I also think that there is nothing this movie does to stand out to make itself great.


**Rating:**
4/5
