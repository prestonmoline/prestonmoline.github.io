**Short Review:**
This is a pretty standard B-tier Aaron Eckhart action movie. The action is a lot of fun, especially when the dog gets involved, but like other B-tier movies, it never seems to have a fully developed plot or characters. Throughout the movie it tries a little too hard to have these purposeful relationships, important flashbacks, and complex story lines, but since the movie is only an hour and a half long, everything that’s not plot-related was not fully developed. Because of this, it was a movie that was full of interesting ideas but with a lackluster execution. What didn’t help the execution was the way it was edited. It had very sharp and jarring editing at times, making certain scenes or flashbacks feel extremely out of place. Additionally, when the movie would take its time to focus on the characters, taking a step away from the overarching plot, every scene felt like there was a scene before that you should have watched but never did, and once these more character-related scenes were over, they had to jump from A to Z very quickly with the plot, leaving me confused at times as to what was going on.

Despite my issues with it, I had an enjoyable enough time with it. The action was good enough to keep my attention, and since it’s only an hour and a half long, I felt like it was worth giving it a shot. Plus it’s always fun watching Aaron Eckhart.

UPDATE 11/18/2025 - I didn't realize this was a sequel to a movie called "Muzzle." Some of the flashbacks could be to the first movie and some other plot-related items I thought were missing could have been in the 1st movie. I'll have to give the original a watch soon to see if it makes me like this one more or if I agree with my initial review.

**Rating:**
2/5
