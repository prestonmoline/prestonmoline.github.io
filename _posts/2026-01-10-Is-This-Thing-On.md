**Review:**
This was so much better than it had any right to be. It is a wonderful relationship dramedy about a couple on the brink of getting a divorce, and Will Arnet and Laura Dern do so well at being that couple. Why are they separating? What initially drew them together? Can they reconcile? Exploring these questions was funny, it was sad, and it was heartwarming at times. It’s one of those movies that made me think about the relationship I have with my wife and how I’m just blessed I have her in my life. I think any movie that can both be extremely entertaining yet also make you think intently about the relationship you have with your spouse (or others, if you’re not married) is definitely worth a watch.


**Rating:**
4.5/5
