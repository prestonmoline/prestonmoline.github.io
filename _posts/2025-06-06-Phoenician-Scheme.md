**Short Review:**
Wes Anderson has always been the kind of director whose movies I want to watch more of, but I never seem to gravitate towards them. This movie was the first full-length film of his I have watched. As some may know, Wes Anderson films have their own style - shot all on practical, minimalist sets, A-tier actors, and a bright and unique color palette. This movie checks all of those boxes, and I loved everything about it. It’s so unique compared to other movies coming out. Additionally, Wes Anderson films also have minimal camera movement, and because of this, scenes don’t seem nearly as fluid as one would expect, making his films seem as if they are a very complex stage production. By having this feeling, the success and entertainment value of the film is solely determined by how well the film is written and how interesting the characters are, which is where this movie falls flat. Despite how lovely the production of the film is, I found the story to be “okay,” and I found the characters “interesting-ish.” Nothing story-wise blew me away, the humor was hit-or-miss, and I left the theater a little disappointed. I don’t know what could have made me enjoy this more, but I just wish I could have been more engaged by the film overall. 


**Rating:**
3/5
