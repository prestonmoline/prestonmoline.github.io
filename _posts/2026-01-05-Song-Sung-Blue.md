**Review:**
I’m not a huge Neal Diamond fan, but I became intrigued about this movie solely due to Hugh Jackman. Also, to my surprise, this movie is based on a true story. Based on the movie that I saw, not only was I blown away by how crazy this couple’s story was, I also thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The acting and singing was fantastic, and I think the movie did a wonderful job at having each of the characters feel real, having everyone embrace their talents, strengths and flaws.

The movie is tricky to review because the couple’s story has so many crazy events that take place, so your enjoyment with the movie will solely be determined by how invested you get in the story and the music. I found myself deeply engaged and invested in their story, and, even though I typically get tired of the music in these music biopics, I surprisingly didn’t get tired of listening to Neal Diamond music. Because I found myself completely immersed in everything, I really liked the movie, but if you’re not a huge fan of Neal Diamond or not up for another music biopic this may not be the movie for you


**Rating:**
4.5/5
