**Review:**
Jurassic World Rebirth is a wonderful addition to the Jurassic Park franchise. I love how it does its best to bring the awe of dinosaurs back to the franchise after the last few movies. There are so many scenes where it just wants to show the beauty and size of the beasts, along with how dangerous they can truly be, especially when face to face with one. What really helped this is how fantastic the dinosaurs actually looked while filming. Gareth Edwards, the director, has such an eye for visual effects, several shots were purposefully framed with dinosaurs in mind, making the dinosaurs feel tangible and real. I also thoroughly loved how the entire movie was short entirely on 35mm film instead of being shot with a digital camera. This gave the movie the feeling and look of being older and nostalgic while being modern. 

Where the movie falls short is during the middle of the film. Through the course of the movie there are 2 groups of people you follow: (1) the scientists/military group and (2) a family lost at sea. Because the movie is having to follow these 2 different groups, it doesnâ€™t allow the audience to spend as much time with the dinosaurs as much as we would both want and expect. I understand why they needed the two groups, especially the family (mainly just to make a more grounded story and for good character development), but spending time with the characters by themselves took away time from doing more with dinosaurs, and it was quite obvious that there should have had more dinos. While I think this, spending more time with the characters allowed the ending to have a more satisfying conclusion, which really makes me wish they could have found a better balance between characters and dinos to make a slightly more satisfying movie. 

Overall, I think this is a wonderful addition to the franchise. I really think there should have been more dinosaurs to get mesmerized by, but I love how it was able to feel like the originals but was able to have its own original story.  


**Rating:**
4/5
