**The Good:**
This movie has a lot of great aspects to it, the music/ambient sound being one of the major ones. I love the sound design. In times of terror, the music screeches, vocalizing the internal terror of people. In times where everyone needs to be silent, the movie is, allowing for any slight noise to stand out. You can literally hear people grabbing popcorn out of their buckets during those parts. In times of joy, the music is incredibly jovial. Being in a movie like this is incredible, and I was blown away by the sound execution. 

One thing I think this movie has better than the other Quiet Place movies is having smart protagonists. While I enjoy the other 2 movies, having the children be part of the main focus of the movie made it so you always thought their decisions could be pretty stupid at times. In this movie the protagonists actually play it smart. They actually make unique decisions to keep themselves safe and to get out of tough situations.

What I also liked more than the original was the sense of danger. While I know the other movies had this overarching presence of terror and shock with the monsters, this movie far surpassed it. Throughout the movie you see shots of dozens of monsters in the city at once, reigning terror to everyone, especially the protagonists. I thought adding more monsters increased the danger factor, allowing the writers to find brilliant situations for our protagonists to escape danger.

As a standout in the movie, Lupita Nyong’o is phenomenal. She acted her heart out, showing so many emotions throughout the movie. She really sold it as if she was fighting for her life the whole movie. It was incredible. 

I think this movie also nailed the ending. I don’t want to spoil it, so I’ll just leave it at this.


**The Meh:**
While I really enjoyed the movie, I think the uncertainty factor of the movie was lacking. In a tense movie like this, I want to be completely unsure of who will survive, who will die, and what bad will happen. Since this movie focused solely on 2 characters (Lupita Nyong’o’s and Joseph Quinn’s characters), I felt like it was obvious they would make it through until the end. If you have that few characters, nothing really bad can happen to them. While I loved how there were so few characters to focus on and connect with, I think it inherently decreased its ability to bring necessary tension to the movie.


**Overall:**
This is a wonderful movie. I think it is as good or better than A Quiet Place parts 1 and 2. I loved the acting, the protagonists, and the ending. I loved how they found a new way to find such an interesting story in the A Quiet Place universe. I just wish the uncertainty factor in this movie matched those of the past movies.



**Rating:**
4/5
