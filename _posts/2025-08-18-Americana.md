**Short Review:**
I don’t care for this movie enough to write a full review about it. The trailers make the movie seem like this intriguing, complex movie about trying to fight over a valuable and sacred  Native American ritual outfit. In actuality the movie is slow paced, the writing is pretty bad, the characters are undeveloped and boring, and the story only gets interesting in the last 15-20 minutes where there is a massive shootout, which was pretty fun. Overall, the film is watchable, but it’s not really worth watching unless you really found the trailer intriguing. 


**Rating:**
1.5/5
