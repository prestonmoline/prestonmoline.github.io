# About

Born and raised in Conway, Arkansas. I've been married since August 2023, and I graduated from BYU in April 2024 with my 
Masters in Accounting, and I'm currently residing in SLC, UT.

I decided to start this website as a way for me to praise, critique, or discuss ways a movie could have been better. I'm by no means a perfect "critic," but I find it quite therapeutic and cathartic to rationalize and break down what I did and did not enjoy with a movie. I feel like it helps me understand myself even more.

Despite critiquing most movies, I tend to enjoy most movies I watch (despite my critiques), not because all of them are good or great, but because they were entertaining to me, and I am easily entertained. This means I will have a different view on rating movies than most people. Here is how I tend to rate my movies:

5 - Perfect

4.5 - Incredible

4 - Amazing

3.5 - Great

3 - Good

2.5- Average

2 - Sub-par

1.5 - Not Good

1 - Bad

.5 - Terrible

I know it's not a perfect rating system, but it works for me. I'm very selective about what gets a 5 and below a 2, so most of my reviews will have a higher-than-average rating compared to others. I know that I can be harsh in some of my reviews, but I'd rather enjoy my time watching and enjoying a movie rather than being hyper critical.
